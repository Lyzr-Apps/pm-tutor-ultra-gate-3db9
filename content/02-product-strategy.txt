CATEGORY 2: PRODUCT STRATEGY
========================================

Product Strategy questions test your ability to think about market dynamics, competitive positioning, business models, growth levers, and long-term product vision. These questions require a combination of analytical thinking and creative vision.

========================================
THE PRODUCT STRATEGY FRAMEWORK
========================================

STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT
Before answering any strategy question, establish:

A. Company Context
- What is the company's mission and vision?
- What stage is the company at? (startup, growth, mature)
- What are the company's core strengths and capabilities?
- What is the current business model and revenue streams?

B. Market Context
- What is the total addressable market (TAM)?
- What are the key market trends and tailwinds?
- Who are the main competitors and how are they positioned?
- Are there regulatory or technology shifts happening?

C. User Context
- Who are the current users/customers?
- What are their unmet needs?
- How are they currently being served (or underserved)?

STEP 2: DEFINE THE STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITY
Frame the opportunity clearly:

1. Market Sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM)
   - TAM (Total Addressable Market): The total market demand for your product category
   - SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market): The portion of TAM you can realistically reach
   - SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market): The portion of SAM you can capture in 1-3 years

   How to calculate:
   - Top-down: Industry reports, analyst estimates, total users x average revenue
   - Bottom-up: Number of potential customers x expected conversion x average deal size
   - Use both approaches and triangulate

2. Competitive Analysis
   A. Direct competitors (same product, same market)
   B. Indirect competitors (different product, same need)
   C. Potential competitors (could enter this market)

   For each competitor, analyze:
   - Value proposition and positioning
   - Strengths and weaknesses
   - Market share and growth trajectory
   - Strategic direction (acquisitions, product launches, partnerships)

3. Competitive Advantage
   Types of sustainable competitive advantages (moats):
   - Network effects (more users = more value for each user)
   - Economies of scale (cost advantages at scale)
   - Switching costs (hard for users to leave)
   - Data advantages (proprietary data that improves the product)
   - Brand (trust, recognition, emotional connection)
   - Technology (patents, proprietary algorithms, unique capabilities)
   - Distribution (unique channels to reach customers)

STEP 3: DEVELOP THE STRATEGY
Present your strategic recommendation:

A. Vision Statement
- Where should the product be in 3-5 years?
- What is the North Star that guides all decisions?

B. Strategic Pillars (typically 3-4)
- Each pillar represents a major area of investment
- Example for a B2B SaaS: (1) Product-led growth, (2) Enterprise expansion, (3) Platform ecosystem, (4) International markets

C. Prioritization
- Which pillar do you pursue first and why?
- What is the sequencing logic?
- What dependencies exist?

D. Go-to-Market Strategy
- How do you acquire customers? (PLG, sales-led, community-led)
- What is the pricing model? (freemium, subscription, usage-based, marketplace)
- What channels will you use for distribution?

STEP 4: DEFINE TRADEOFFS AND RISKS
Every strategy involves tradeoffs. Be explicit:
- What are you choosing NOT to do?
- What are the biggest risks to this strategy?
- How would you mitigate each risk?
- What would make you pivot or change direction?

PRODUCT STRATEGY TIPS
========================================

1. Always quantify your arguments — use market size estimates, percentages, and financial projections
2. Show awareness of second-order effects — what happens after your strategy succeeds?
3. Think about timing — why is now the right time?
4. Consider the organizational implications — does the company have the capabilities to execute?
5. Be opinionated — strategy requires making choices, not hedging
6. Show competitive empathy — understand what competitors will do in response
7. Connect strategy to execution — great strategy without an execution plan is just a wish
8. Think in time horizons: What do we do this quarter? This year? Over 3 years?
9. Reference real company examples to demonstrate pattern recognition
10. Balance ambition with realism — show you can dream big and plan practically
